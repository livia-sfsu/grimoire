mostly operating system arcana about a class [Livia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livia) occasionally teaches.

## awesome

for all your emulation needs look no more [QEMU the FAST! processor emulator](https://www.qemu.org) has got you covered for free. become a master and you'll never need another one. 

javascript? [PCjs Machines](https://www.pcjs.org/) is for you. awesome old-school graphics. loading your stuff needs some doing. become a master and you can debug a pc in realtime, no kidding.

when working on my routine i usually listen to [some serene and relaxing new-age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZbkF-15ObM) music while i peruse the [linux-insides](https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/).

straight from the man, [the linux source](https://github.com/torvalds/linux).

### 2019-10-5
 - [the linux system call table](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/syscalls.html) explained as a nice table.
 - [this](https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/Booting/linux-bootstrap-1.html) in the [linux insides](https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/).
 - the [BIOS source code](http://www.intel-assembler.it/portale/5/ibm-at-286-souce-code/ibm-at-286-souce-code.asp).
 - [even older](https://sites.google.com/site/pcdosretro/ibmpcbios) (read: easier to read) versions. 
 - [windows needs to boot too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_startup_process), like any other.
 -  you can multitask on anything, [even an arduino](https://github.com/rahra/minios) if you try hard enough.
